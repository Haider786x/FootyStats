This repository contains only the backend service of the main application.
It is not a standalone product and does not include any frontend/UI code.

The backend is responsible exclusively for handling real-time match data, including:

Live match updates

Match statistics

Team and fixture-related data

API integrations for real-time sports information

This service is designed to act as a core backend module that integrates with the main application’s frontend and other services.
